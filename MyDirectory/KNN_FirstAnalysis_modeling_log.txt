The scikit-learn (sklearn)-based Python workflow is inspired by an older caret-based R workflow (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-023-09667-w), independently supports both modeling (i.e., training and testing) and prediction (i.e., based on a pre-built model), and implements 4 feature selection methods, 14 model classifiers, hyperparameter tuning, performance metric computation, feature and permutation importance analyses, prediction probability estimation, execution monitoring via progress bars, and parallel processing.

The traceback level was set to 20
The warnings were ignored
The recommended versions of Python and packages were properly controlled
The modeling subcommand was used
The provided sample limit per class and dataset (i.e., 10) meets or exceeds the recommended minimum (i.e., 10), which is expected to support more reliable performance metrics
The provided phenotype harbored 3 classes: 'fruit', 'pig', 'poultry'
The minimum required number of samples in the training/testing datasets (i.e., >= 60) and the expected number of columns (i.e., >= 3) in the input file of mutations were properly controlled (i.e., 200 and 11 , respectively)
The minimum required number of samples in the training/testing datasets (i.e., >= 60) and the expected number of columns (i.e., = 3) in the input file of phenotypes were properly controlled (i.e., 200 and 3 , respectively)
The absence of missing phenotypes in the input file of phenotypes was properly controled (i.e., the second column)
The expected datasets (i.e., 'training' or 'testing') in the input file of phenotypes were properly controled (i.e., the third column)
The sorted sample identifiers were confirmed as identical between the input files of mutations and phenotypes/datasets
The phenotype classes were not encoded for the classifiers other than the XGB classifier
The provided selection of training/testing datasets (i.e., manual) and percentage of random splitting (i.e., None) were compatible
The training and testing datasets were constructed based on the 'manual' setting
The number of samples per class in the training and testing datasets was properly controlled to be higher than the set limit (i.e., 10)
The input tested mutations include all features required by the trained one-hot encoder
The input tested mutations contain no unexpected features for one-hot encoding
The encoded features between training and testing datasets were confirmed as identical
The one-hot encoded column order was harmonized across training and testing datasets to ensure deterministic feature alignment for feature selection and modeling
The 10 provided features were one-hot encoded into 80 encoded features
The provided feature selection method was properly recognized: SelectKBest (SKB)
The provided classifier was properly recognized: k-nearest neighbors (KNN)
The pipeline components were properly recognized: Pipeline(steps=[('feature_selection', SelectKBest(score_func=functools.partial(<function mutual_info_classif at 0x7fa40a8a09a0>, random_state=42))), ('model', KNeighborsClassifier())])
The tuning parameters were provided by the user: {'feature_selection__k': 25, 50, 'feature_selection__score_func': <function mutual_info_classif at 0x7fa40a8a09a0>, 'model__n_neighbors': 5, 11, 17, 'model__metric': 'euclidean', 'manhattan', 'model__p': 1, 2}
The cross-validation setting implied: 5 distinct parameter names, 10 parameter value options, 24 parameter combinations, and 120 fits during cross-validation
The tqdm_joblib progress bars are activated when using two or more jobs
The best parameters during model cross-validation were: {'feature_selection__k': 50, 'feature_selection__score_func': <function mutual_info_classif at 0x7fa40a8a09a0>, 'model__metric': 'euclidean', 'model__n_neighbors': 5, 'model__p': 1}
The best accuracy during model cross-validation was: 0.90625
The pipeline potentially selected and used 50 one-hot encoded features to train the model
The one-hot encoded feature names were recovered from the model or encoder
The selected classifier does not expose feature importances natively (NaN placeholder (no native importance))
The permutation importance was requested (i.e., True) and the number of repetitions was explicitly set (i.e., True) to a specific value (i.e., 5)
The permutation importance was successfully computed on both training and testing datasets
The output directory already existed

Note: NaN placeholder in case no native or detectable feature importance is available. 
Note: AdaBoost (ADA) typically produces binary feature importances (0 or 1) because each weak learner splits on only one feature. 
Note: Boosting models, especially Histogram-based Gradient Boosting (HGB), may yield all-zero feature importances when no meaningful split gains are computed—typically due to strong regularization, shallow trees, or low feature variability.

Note: The term 'support' corresponds to TP + FN. 
Note: MCC stands for Matthews Correlation Coefficient. 
Note: Sensitivity and recall must be equal, as they are based on the same formula. 
Note: In the case of binary phenotype, the negative and positive classes correspond to the first and second classes in alphabetical order, respectively. 
Note: PRG-AUC can be negative, reflecting below-baseline performance expected with imbalanced data, while PRG-AUC_clipped floors negative gains to zero to separate total performance (including penalties) from above-baseline contributions, coinciding with PRG-AUC when the model stays above baseline. 
Note: A PRG-AUC close to 0.5 for a specific class does not necessarily indicate poor performance. In binary or one-vs-rest evaluations, it reflects limited precision gain over the random baseline (e.g., SVC).
